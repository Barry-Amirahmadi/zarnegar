/**
 * Open Graph card generator.
 *
 * **No social crawler renders an SVG `og:image`**, so the share card is a
 * raster: `public/media/og-card.jpg`, 1200×630, at most 200 KB.
 *
 * The left half is a photograph — `hero-main.jpg` — filling a full-height 600×630
 * panel, cropped to cover from its centre. The right half is the card as it
 * was before the photographs existed, still drawn below exactly as it was, then
 * cut to the 600px around the mark: the mark keeps its scale and sits centred
 * in its half. **Nothing is drawn over the photograph**, so no contrast pair
 * depends on its pixels.
 *
 * The first card came out of a hand-written PNG encoder in plain Node. Node
 * cannot decode a JPEG and this project has exactly three runtime
 * dependencies, so the card is now composed on a canvas inside the Chromium
 * that Playwright already installs for the smoke suite — the same route as
 * `import-media.mjs`. Quality is walked down from 0.9 until the file fits.
 * The script then decodes its own output and measures it: the pixel size, the
 * bytes, and how far the right half drifted from the card it was cut from.
 *
 * The card is the same art direction as `generate-media.mjs` — shabaq ground,
 * a defocused tonal mass, light falling from the top-right, which is the RTL
 * reading origin — with the brand mark from `src/app/icon.svg` over it. It
 * carries no type: rendering Persian into a generated raster needs a font
 * pipeline this project does not have, and a Latin-only card for a Persian
 * brand would read worse than a clean mark.
 *
