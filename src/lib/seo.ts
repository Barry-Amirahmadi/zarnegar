/**
 * Absolute URLs for canonicals, Open Graph, the sitemap and structured data.
 *
 * All four need a *full* URL — a root-relative path is meaningless to a crawler
 * that found the page somewhere else — and composing one here is the only place
 * the two halves of the deployed address are put back together.
 *
 * They arrive separately and this is the trap: `actions/configure-pages` reports
 * `origin` and `base_path` as two outputs, and the deploy workflow passes them
 * in as two variables. On a GitHub Pages *project* site the origin is
 * `https://user.github.io` while the site actually lives at
 * `https://user.github.io/repo`. Anything built from the origin alone is a URL
 * that resolves to somebody else's page — a canonical pointing at the wrong
 * site is worse than none at all, because it actively tells a search engine to
 * index that one instead.

 * root layout and inherited unchanged by all six routes, so every shared link
 * previewed as the homepage regardless of what it pointed at.
 *
 * Two Next behaviours this works around deliberately:
 *
 * - The title is set as `absolute`, bypassing the root's `%s — زرنگار`
 *   template, and the same composed string is used for `og:title`. The template
 *   applies to `<title>` only, so routing both through one variable is what
 *   keeps them from drifting apart again.
 * - `openGraph` and `twitter` are merged shallowly: a route that declares
 *   `openGraph` at all does **not** inherit the parent's `openGraph.images`.
 *   Hence the card is repeated here rather than left to the layout.
